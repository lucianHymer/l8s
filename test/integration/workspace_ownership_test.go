	// This test documents the fix for workspace volume ownership:
	// 
	// Problem: When Podman creates named volumes, they are owned by root by default.
	// Even though the Dockerfile sets ownership correctly, mounted volumes override this.
	//
	// Solution: Use the :U option on volume mounts. This tells Podman to automatically
	// chown the volume contents to match the user that the container runs as.
	//
	// The fix was implemented in pkg/container/podman_client.go:
	// - Added Options: []string{"U"} to both home and workspace volume definitions
	//
	// This ensures that:
	// 1. /workspace is owned by the container user (dev)
	// 2. /home/dev is owned by the container user (dev)
	// 3. No manual chown commands are needed after container creation
