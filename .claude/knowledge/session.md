### [13:04] [gotcha] MCP mim server protocol error
**Details**: The mim MCP server fails with Zod validation errors when connecting. The server appears to be sending error messages with an 'error' field, but Claude Code expects MCP messages to have 'id', 'method', and 'result' fields. This causes the connection to drop immediately after establishing. The error suggests a protocol mismatch where mim's error response format doesn't conform to the expected MCP message schema.

### [13:23] [gotcha] ZSH plugin missing from embedded dotfiles
**Details**: When the dotfiles were reorganized to separate host integration from container dotfiles, the .oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/l8s directory was moved from dotfiles/ to host-integration/, but it seems the container still needs the ZSH plugin files to be embedded for tab completion to work inside containers. The files were moved in commit 9031fcf but the container-side plugin files may have been lost in the process.

### [13:30] [architecture] Host integration embedding system
**Details**: Added a new embedding system for host integration files (like the ZSH plugin). Created pkg/embed/host_integration.go which embeds the host-integration directory and provides ExtractZSHPlugin() to install the plugin. Also added a new 'l8s install-zsh-plugin' command that extracts the embedded ZSH completion plugin to the user's Oh My Zsh installation. This replaces the broken Makefile approach that was trying to copy from non-existent pkg/embed/dotfiles/.oh-my-zsh directory. The host integration files are now properly separated from container dotfiles - they're embedded in the binary for host installation but not included in containers.
**Files**: pkg/embed/host_integration.go, pkg/cli/factory_lazy.go, pkg/cli/handlers.go, cmd/l8s/main.go
